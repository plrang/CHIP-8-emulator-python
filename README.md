Watch the video, read more and get the documentation https://plrang.com/blog/chip8-emulator-making/

<pre><code># Back to WIP - adding features
# This is a working emulator, in that sense it's finished,
# yet the code architecture, formatting , comments
# and some other planned functionalities are not yet in place</code></pre>

In a few words, the CHIP 8 is the simplest public emulator you could try to recreate if you want to begin your journey with emulators, or just to know how does emulator/interpreter work. In fact the CHIP 8 never was a real device, just a virtual concept. Yet every device starts in a such way. So it's the best way to start.

This is the Windows version, easy to convert to Linux. It's proven to work. I will upload also the Linux version soon.
There will be also the Python 3.x version available and Blender 3D script to run it in the 3D environment.
You'll find a lot of comments from me and from the documentation right in the script. A live console output is available for the emulator, pseudo assembler display, registers etc.

You may want to read also the introduction in the script 'chip8emu.py' file for more tips.

<b>How to install and run</b>

Download or clone the files. 
Download ROM files (*.ch8) from the web and put them inside the [ROMs] folder, then add or comment out in the script source.

<b>Enter the command to run the emulator</b>

<pre><code>chip8emu.py</code></pre>

Use up and down arrows to switch the ROM in realtime. Use the numeric keypad keys to TRY TO PLAY, cause it's not se easy.
