CHIP 8 emulator Python 2.7 / Pygame - case study

Watch the video, read more and get the documentation https://plrang.com/blog/chip8-emulator-making/

In a few words CHIP 8 is the simplest public emulator you could try to recreate if you want to begin your journey with emulators, or just to know how does it work. In fact the CHIP 8 never was a real device, just a virtual concept. Yet every device starts in a such way. So it's the best way to start.

This is the Windows version, easy to convert to Linux. It's proven to work. I will upload also the Linux version soon.
There will be also the Python 3.x version available.
There is a lot of comments from me and the documentation in the code, also there is a live console output available for the emulator, pseudo assembler display, registers etc.

You may want to read also the introduction in the script 'chip8emu.py' file for more tips.

<b>How to install and run</b>

Download or clone the files. The "ROMs" directory contains the public domain ROM files with simple games and demos.

Enter the command to run the emulator.
<pre><code>
 	chip8emu.py
</code></pre>

Use up and down arrows to switch the ROM in the realtime. Use the numeric keypad keys to TRY TO PLAY, cause it's not se easy.
